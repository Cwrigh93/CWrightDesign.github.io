                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>
                    During the summer before my senior year in college,
                    I was sent an email about an opportunity to work with 3D printing to make prosthetics for
                    individuals that lacked certain limbs. The aim of this project was to develop a 3D printed
                    prosthetic for an end-user.
                    I had the honor to work with four other likeminded individuals, some who had experience in 3D
                    printing and some who didn’t.
                    We sought to make a prosthetic that was functional, comfortable and user-friendly while also keeping
                    aesthetics in mind.
                    The recipient was a young woman who would be attending UNC Charlotte in the coming semester.</p>

                <p>
                    Coming into this project I lacked experience with 3D printing unlike most of the team. This was not
                    a problem since none of us had ever 3D printed and assembled prosthetics for a person which left us
                    all at an elementary level. Each of us was given the task of printing and assembling a hand. I used
                    this time period to get to know my teammates on a personal level as well as understanding the way
                    they thought about the project we had underway.

                    Before deciding on the exact device we wanted to build, each of us attempted to build a device using
                    the 3D printers. We each printed and assembled Phoenix hands which are a type of 3D printed
                    prosthetic, powered by wrist movement. Once we were done constructing our test Phoenix hands, we met
                    with the person who would be receiving the prosthetic we were to make. Before the meeting, we
                    constructed a list of goals that we aimed to meet.</p>

                    Getting to know the end-user was the most significant part of the process. The group had to approach
                    this part
                    of the project with caution due to the fragile nature of it. The main goal from our perspective was
                    to make the end-user feel welcomed and not feel as if we were there to simply inspect her limb
                    difference. The key
                    thing here was that she
                    nor any other person is defined by there disability. With us being relatively close in age, it
                    wasn't too difficult to
                    connect outside of the main topic.

                <p>
                    During the last few phases of the project, we started to research Participatory design and thought
                    of ways to incorporate
                    it into our design process. After the days of strategizing, we had finally come up with what we
                    wanted to implement during the session,
                    and it would be led by myself, with the others participating in the activities to give the end-user
                    a feeling of inclusion as she would be surrounded by equals. As a result of this session, the
                    participant was more open than ever
                    and supplied us with detailed information as well as design decisions that we would later implement.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    As a result of our user research and participatory design sessions, we came up with multiple
                    additions to the original Phoenix hand that would qualify as a solution to our end users’ eyes. We
                    conducted a participatory design session that included user testing of our first prototype and found
                    that the prototype was slightly small which was
                    the opposite of her previous hands. She was still capable of trying the hand on and using the
                    writing utensil that was fixed to it. Thanks to the
                    activities we found out the things that mattered most to the end-user and not the things that we
                    believe would matter the most. Aesthetics was one of the most important things to the end-user but
                    she also wanted a functional hand because none of her previous hands could qualify as being
                    functional due to poor design and inaccurate sizing.

                <p>There was much to learn as a result of this experience. One aspect of this experience that taught me
                    a lot was the user research component. I also learned a lot about 3D printing. I used 3D printers of
                    various sizes as well as different
                    slicers and modeling software. From my experience, using rafts on bigger prints and printers are
                    more of a hindrance than support due to the thickness of the rafts. Once its time for removal, it’s
                    nearly impossible to get a clean separation. Before going into this project I had a preconceived
                    notion that 3D printing was full-proof and didn’t fail. As seen in the image above, it doesn’t take
                    much to get a failed print.</p>

                <p>
                    One of the more important things I have learned is how to implement the participatory design method.
                    The team and I attempted to use participatory design to generate better input from the end-user, get
                    her involved in the design process and have her feel as if she was truly apart of creating something
                    that will positively impact her lifestyle. I had the chance to conduct the popular wallet activity,
                    which was fun but could be challenging depending on the participants. It was one of the more
                    enjoyable experiences I’ve had as far as coursework.</p>
