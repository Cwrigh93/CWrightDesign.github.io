                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Going to the gym is one of my favorite pastimes. It's said that we should treat our bodies as if they
                    were a temple
                    and I believe that this is something that should be followed. I've recognized with alot of people
                    that ask me to
                    guide or train them, the reasons in which they haven't embarked on a fitness journey. Some people
                    are lazy while others
                    are scared and confused. Schools don't give proper lessons on nutrition and can mislead students
                    into thinking certain things
                    are true while they aren't. The MaxFit app would help users take the step into the right direction
                    when it comes to their health.

                <p>" I got a gym membership during that burst of motivation everyone gets in January, then I got nervous
                    and scared."
                </p>
                <p>"If you have a friend who is interested in exercising you could go to the gym together.
                    I know for a fact that having someone you trust with you makes it easier"

                    "I only worry that people might notice any bad form or me not knowing how to use the equipment
                    properly."
                </p>
                <p>"It's not free and because I don't want to show off my
                    soft body and poor stamina to people who might look better and be able to do more."
                </p>
                <p> "I'm terrified of looking like an idiot in front of a bunch of people.
                    And I hate the idea of wasting money on such an experience.
                    And I'm really lazy.""

                    MaxFit incorporates the most crucial aspects of fitness. These include cardio, diet, and physical
                    movement whether it be weight training, resistance, calisthenics, or plyometrics. As we learned
                    earlier one of the biggest reasons people don't monitor their health is because they lack knowledge
                    of these three areas of health and fitness. The other big reason is that people are scared to go to
                    the gym because they have this preconceived notion that the normal gym-goers will look down upon
                    them or they will embarrass themselves by looking confused. MaxFit combats all of these problems by
                    giving the users programs and templates that are customizable through an easy to use interface. One
                    of the best things about being active is that you don't necessarily need to be a member of a gym.
                    The application will give users access to home-based training options as well as nutrition options.

                    The thing that separates this app from the rest is the versatility. There are apps such as BodySpace
                    and MyFitnessPal that only do one thing and it's usually dedicated to that one task. Someone looking
                    to start a health journey would have to download and use four or five different applications which
                    can become annoying and tiresome. MaxFit is a one-stop for all one's fitness needs.
