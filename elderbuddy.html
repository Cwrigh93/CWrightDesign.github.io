                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>The Elder Buddy Served as my introduction into the world of User Experience and Interface Design.
                    This project is what drove me to take the
                    HCI route instead of information technology. The Elder Buddy is the result of the design process and
                    criteria set by our professor that was to be met. We wanted to design a new app that would aid
                    elderly individuals in everyday tasks that are crucial to their wellbeing. This was an interesting
                    journey and a true challenge.</P>
                <h1>My Role</h1>
                <p>
                    During this project which ran the entirety of the course, I held the role of a group leader. It was
                    my job to push deadlines and oftentimes I found myself clarifying objectives for my fellow team
                    members. It was quite an interesting experience since not only was I
                    tasked with
                    clarifying things but I was also simultaneously learning just as my teammates were.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    First, there was the task of finding out what kind of application we should make. The professor of
                    the course had guidelines that were to be followed. The main thing was to create an application that
                    would be centered around helping old or elderly people. With this in mind, the question we had to
                    ask ourselves was, “What is it that elderly people could use to help make their lives easier?”. As a
                    group, we put our thoughts and ideas together to come up with something that we believed would help
                    our target demographic.

            <div class="col-lg-1"></div>
            <div class="col-lg-10">
                <p>As a group, this was our first needfinding phase ever. Due to the project being in class
                    our needfinding started with simple interviews of other students centered around their grandparents.
                    The individuals interviewed had grandparents over 65 years old. Health was the top theme we ran
                    across while reviewing the data. Nine out of ten of the individuals we interviewed stated that their
                    grandparents had to take some type of medication. The health problems varied and some of the
                    individuals had multiple problems. About half of the interviewee’s grandparents used social media
                    and a third of them used GPS to get home.

                    As stated above the goal of our app is to make life easier for the elderly as the name suggests
                    “Elder Buddy”. We mainly focused on three things: help them keep track of their medicine schedule,
                    help them find their car, and give them the choice to share their location with family and friends.
                    We made sure that the app is easy to navigate, has optimized user flow, and a design-friendly
                    interface (finger-friendly) covering the goals of the usability. We evaluated our app using the
                    wizard of oz interview and experimental usability study, where we received users input about the
                    app, what they liked about and what they thought we should change. Overall they found the
                    functionality of the app easy to understand and follow. Most of the suggestions for improvements
                    were centered around making the app more visually appealing.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Once again, our design concept was intended to be far from complex. It incorporates a smart device
                    with interaction through human touch. Touch and sight for real-time feedback are the only things
                    necessary for the interaction since our app doesn’t incorporate sound or video streaming. The
                    biggest thing to take into consideration was the ages of our users and what kind of previous
                    experience they have had with technology. As a result of our research and implementation based on
                    the feedback received from target users, our application was closer to being a success.
