                    This project was centered around design patterns, tools and the implementation of each.
                    My group had to decided on a board game and redesign it using the tools and design patterns that we
                    were taught. By the end of the project, we were expected to have a semi-functional prototype in
                    which a single
                    round of the game could be simulated.</p>

                <h1>My Role</h1>
                <p>
                    During this project I didn't assume the role of leader but I did guide us in the beginning because I
                    had
                    knowledge of User interfaces and User Experience. There were three of us in a group but one member
                    didn't pull
                    his weight at all, therefore I had to step up in order to complete his assigned task as well. While
                    we learned new
                    design patterns and practices it was up to us to implement them into our User Interface.

                    My partner and I decided to go with Pictionary. Pictionary is a game where teams draw things that
                    must be guessed by other people.
                    This game doesn't involve technology but we intended to make it to where players could use Ipads and
                    tablets to play
                    without having to deal with physical pieces. Going into this project I had worked with Balsamiq and
                    Axure while my
                    partner had experience with Balsamiq.</p>

                    There was a lot to introduce and keep in mind when we were attempting to convert a hands on game such as pictionary
                    into a digital form. It was also challenging to meet all of the required criteria set by the professor. Some of the design patterns
                    we were supposed to implement didn't align with our vision for the game, nor were they necessary components.

                <p>This experience was very fulfilling in terms of knowledge and experience. We used many difference
                    types of
                    prototyping tools and methods such as Axure, powerpoint and video prototyping which I had never been
                    introduced to.
                    I believe this course and project will impact my professional career more than any other course I
                    have taken during my time as
                    a undergraduate.

                    I would be lying if I said that we didn't run into any problems. The problem with the team member
                    that didn't care nor try to carry
                    their weight is something that I would expect to see once I actually join the work force. It's great
                    (in a sense) that I have exposure to such
                    an occurrence and know ways to deal with it. One thing I wish that could've been different is that we
                    had a chance to do more user testing on our product
                    as well as pick something entirely different then what was within the criteria.</p>
